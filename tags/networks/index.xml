      <description>Intersectional data, racism and bias A necessary caveat As a white, CIS-gendered, Gen X, heterosexual male, my strategy since the spring of 2020 has been to shut the hell up, cede space to, and amplify the voices that matter in addressing racism and bias in our society.
I&amp;rsquo;m aware of my privilege and hope to use it to celebrate the value in diversity and help others in making our world a more inclusive place.</description>

      <description>Network Graph of Canadian Legislation I’ve been talking about doing this one for a while, but had a bit of spare time tonight and finally completed the first cut of a network graph of Canadian legislation and the linkages between the Acts. The raw data for the graph is taken from Jason White’s excellent Gitlawca repository on GitHub.
A full resolution image is available on my Dropbox account here.
I used Python, BeautifulSoup and NetworkX to pull down the raw HTML, scrape it for links and pull out the names of legislation.</description>
