      <description>Network Graph of Canadian Legislation I’ve been talking about doing this one for a while, but had a bit of spare time tonight and finally completed the first cut of a network graph of Canadian legislation and the linkages between the Acts. The raw data for the graph is taken from Jason White’s excellent Gitlawca repository on GitHub.&#xA;A full resolution image is available on my Dropbox account here.&#xA;I used Python, BeautifulSoup and NetworkX to pull down the raw HTML, scrape it for links and pull out the names of legislation.</description>
